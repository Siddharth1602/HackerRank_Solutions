    "The Hamming distance is a measure of the difference between two strings of equal length. It is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols in the two strings are different. For example, the Hamming distance between the strings \"10101\" and \"11100\" is 3, because there are three positions where the symbols differ.\n",
